ecs is done, but not perfect

- fix ecs alignment XD
- add pagination to ecs (less memory = gud)

- fix sign conversion warnings in stbi

-- sprite batching

foreach sprite component:
	send renderer sprite position, scale & atlas coord;
	renderer creates a biog vao with all the data and sends a draw call

atlas coords should work as indices (spr_atlas[x][y]);
